Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student from [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) (under the successive postgraduate and doctoral programs). My research interest includes data marketplaces, data mining, and data-efficient AI.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jinfei Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jinfeiliu) of DIVER Lab. Before that, I received my bachelor degree from China University of Petroleum, Beijing, majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics.

You can find my CV here: [Yicheng Fu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
